        One year ago, we decided to launch our very first Anywhere Worker study to better
         understand this growing population of workers who are embracing remote jobs and embarking
          on epic travels around the world. This year, we decided to conduct our second edition of the
           study to shed light on the latest trends among all of the traveling workers out there. We surveyed 2,
           000 Anywhere Workers and guess what? These free-spirited souls are racking up passport stamps like never
            before! They've upped their travel game, opting for longer adventures across the globe.

        After a year we can see the reasons why they travel are as diverse as the destinations they visit.
         Some crave the flexibility to dance to their own tune, while others seek thrills and spills that
          can only be found on the road. Many have grown tired of the mundane 9-5 office grind and yearn for
           something more extraordinary. Some are simply going through personal transitions and find solace in
            this nomadic lifestyle. And let's not forget the influencers who have inspired others to follow in their
             footsteps.

<p>

    Over 80% of these nomads plan to live the Anywhere Worker lifestyle for up to 5 years
    Nearly 80% of Anywhere Workers embrace the nomadic lifestyle, moving from one exciting loca
    tion to another every 6 months. That's a 16% increase in their globe-trotting habits compared 
    to last year
    <br>
    The population of Anywhere Workers is diverse, but the majority belong to the adventurous millennial 
    crowd. They've gained enough work experience to secure full-time remote positions, affording them the lib
    erty to work and wanderlust on their terms. Women are also leading the charge in the Anywhere Worker revolution,
     fueled by their thirst for freedom and autonomy:
     <br>
    
    A whopping 36% of female Anywhere Workers prioritize flexibility and autonomy, eclipsing the 33% of their male counterparts 
    For 34% of women Anywhere Workers, the motivation to embrace this lifestyle stems from their desire to break free from the monot
    onous 9-5 routine and break the chains of staying in one place. In comparison, 31% of men share the same sentiment

    In the realm of Anywhere Worker wanderlust, Europe and the US take center stage. Spain steals the 
    show as the most popular country to visit, followed closely by Portugal and Italy

    <br>

    Stateside, the concrete jungle of New York City and the vast landscapes of Texas claim the top spots
    <br>    
    
    Nearly all (94%) Anywhere Workers reported stable or increased earnings since embarking on their nomadic
     journeys. It's like they've struck gold while chasing rainbows! 

     <br>

     This is a 10% increase from the previous year. Financial worries have taken a backseat, with a 15% decrease in 
     the number of Anywhere Workers facing money troubles. Looks like their passports are enjoying a healthy diet of visa
      stamps and dollar bills
